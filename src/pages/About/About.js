              Hi there my name is Eileen Avci. I am an enthusiastic creator passionate about UX design, AI, and Frontend engineering, based in Seattle, WA. I am currently a senior at the University of Washington Bothell, majoring in Applied Computing and Minoring in Visual Arts and Media, graduating in March 2026.
            </p>

              I believe that design choices should be scientific, purpose-driven, and human-centered. When I am not designing or coding, you can find me swimming or drawing. Thanks for stopping by!

        <p>
I believe design decisions should be grounded in UX research and informed by science, and I am always looking for ways to improve the user experience. This philosophy shapes my design process. Before bringing ideas to life with tools like Figma and React, I focus on understanding users through surveys, user interviews, and online research. Every time I go through that process, I am fascinated by the diverse and unexpected needs and tools of each unique user.   
        </p>
        <p>
          My recent work reflects my growing interest in AI and agent design. I see AI not as a replacement for human creativity, but as a powerful tool that enhances and accelerates it. I strive to integrate AI into my projects as a tool that adapts to diverse users' needs, tailoring the user experience to each user. For example, I am currently working on my capstone project—an AI-powered scheduler—designed to help users automate employee scheduling, taking into account each employee’s availability preferences.
